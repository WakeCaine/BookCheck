--- Update 12.10.2016 ---
In a week i will submit what i did. (project is on hold) It is not ideal. Code is garbage in some places. I tried my best to detect text and OCR each area but i'm not experienced in OpenCV, so i had no real success. 
I also tried to change image before putting to Tesseract to OCR but results were far from perfect. If i had time to spare, i would take all of important code into another project to see how Tesseract reacts to different settings. 
In current form it compiles very long and works very slowly. You can also sometimes experience memory leak probably caused by hanged threads that i forgot about. If i find time i will search and clean it all.

If somebody has will to use this code and finds what caused memory leak, i can pull it into the project right away.
